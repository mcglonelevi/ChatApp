# ChatApp

This is a basic prototype chat application that I wrote for a school project at Franklin University.  We were supposed to use a new technology to develop a web application.  I chose to use WebSockets and also try Vagrant with Ansible for some basic provisioning.  I was able to utilize some open-source Ansible roles to make my life a little easier.
