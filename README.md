# ChatApp

This is a basic prototype chat application that I wrote for a school project at Franklin University.  We were supposed to use a new technology to develop a web application.  I chose to use WebSockets, Vagrant, and Ansible for my new technologies.  I used WebSockets and NodeJS to build a very basic instant message application that stored messages into a MongoDB store.  I was able to utilize some open-source Ansible roles that made deployment a little easier.
